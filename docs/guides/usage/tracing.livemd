# Tracing Function Calls

```elixir
# Install Matcha
Mix.install([{:matcha, github: "christhekeele/matcha", tag: "tracing-docs"}])
# Make macros accessible
require Matcha
```

## An introduction to the tracing engine

The BEAM VM has the powerful ability to report when (almost) any function in any module is called, from any process in a distributed system, to your current process. For example, to know when any function in the `String` module is called, we can trace it:

```elixir
Matcha.Trace.module(String)
```

Now, we will be told the next time an `Enum` function is called:

```elixir
Enum.map(["foo", "bar"], &String.capitalize())
```

As with all powerful things, this must be used responsiblyâ€”

```elixir
spec =
  Matcha.spec :trace do
    {x, y, z} -> {x, y, z}
  end
```
